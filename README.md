Code for predictive HTE analysis of the IST-3 Trial.
The manuscript is currently in Revision for _Anesthesia & Analgesia_.
The code is heavily influenced by Ewout Steyerberg's blog entry "Implementation of the PATH Statement" (https://www.fharrell.com/post/path/), credit for the implementation of the PATH statement in R goes entirely to him. The code was adapted for tidyverse and to the IST-3 trial.
